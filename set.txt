There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets. 
You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.
set3 = set1.union(set2)
set3=set1|set2

The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.
eg : set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
set3 = set1 & set2    You can use the & operator instead of the intersection() method, and you will get the same result
 
The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).
set3 = set1.difference(set2)
set3 = set1 - set2

The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.
delete the same items and only keep the remaiinig elements from both sets
set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
set3 = set1 ^ set2
